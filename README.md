HACKATON NOV 2017


App to inspire ideas of fun things to plan on doing. Search options provide listings for the local address you provided corresponding to the  current dates. Data is pulled from Yelp and Eventkick apis. Chat functionality provided in order to ask others for advice and recommendations about things to do. 

Simply clone and npm install. 
You will have to manually sign in since facebook authorization is only functional on my end as the app has not been approved yet by facebook.
